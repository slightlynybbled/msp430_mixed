# Purpose #
The purpose of this repository is to inform those who wish to write assembly routines for their C code. I have found that the compiler documentation - though adequate - is something less than desireable for the community at large to get started.

Having said that, before you go writing a ton of assembly code for C, read the compiler documentation! Otherwise, you may write assembly code that will interfere with your compiler-generated code!

Simply drop these files into your new MSP430 CCS project!  I used the MSP430F2231 for debugging, but the instructions should apply to all MSP430-series devices.
